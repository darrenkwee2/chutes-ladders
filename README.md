We started Android studio, but decided based on time restrictions to stick with JavaFX for visuals. 
At the moment, the only incomplete gameplay element is a visual representation of the chutes and ladders. In practice, these elements exist, ie. when a player lands on that space they move to the correct spot, however there is no visual representation. 
For some reason, the game doesn't run in BlueJ, however it works in eclipse.
